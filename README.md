# World Weather Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to be able to map cities throughout the world, and give customers the capability of choosing their weather preferences. This incorporates mapping weather conditions, having customers choose their ideal weather, providing nearby lodging based on weather and building an intinerary for a trip. 
## Results 
By asking for a user's temperature preference, we are able to generate a map that displays a temperature view, and markers for hotels that fall within the temperature preference. 

### Weather Vacation Map

By looking at this map, customers can clearly see what areas are within their temperature preference and the hotels suggested for those cities. Customers can use this interactive map to begin planning an itinerary, with the cities and hotels provided.
